A strategic online board game inspired by Stratego where players command armies with hidden unit identities.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- MongoDB (local or cloud connection)

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup:**
```bash
cd epoch_battles
```

2. **Server setup:**
```bash
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your MongoDB URI and JWT secret
```

3. **Client setup:**
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

### Running the Application

1. **Start MongoDB** (if running locally)

2. **Start the server:**
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```
Server runs on http://localhost:3001

3. **Start the client (in a new terminal):**
```bash
cd client
npm start
```
Client runs on http://localhost:3000

## Current Status

âœ… **Phase 1 Complete - Core Infrastructure:**
- User authentication (register/login)

- **Frontend:** React + styled-components + Socket.IO client
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing

## Development

### Backend Commands
```bash
npm run dev     # Start development server
npm test        # Run tests
npm run lint    # Check code style
```

### Frontend Commands

## Game Rules

Epoch Battles is inspired by Stratego with these core mechanics:

- **Hidden Identity:** Opponent can't see your piece types until combat
- **Strategic Combat:** Different units have different combat strengths
- **Objective:** Capture the opponent's flag to win
- **Special Units:** Scouts (move multiple spaces), Miners (defuse bombs), Spy (defeats Marshal)
